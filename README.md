# [TED-CDB: A Large-Scale Chinese Discourse Relation Dataset on TED Talks](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.223/)
Here is the dataset of paper TED-CDB: A Large-Scale Chinese Discourse Relation Dataset on TED Talks. As different genres are known to differ in their communicative properties and as previously, for Chinese, discourse relations have only been annotated over news text, we have created the TED-CDB dataset. TED-CDB comprises a large set of TED talks in Chinese that have been manually annotated according to the goals and principles of Penn Discourse Treebank, but adapted to features that are not present in English. It serves as a unique Chinese corpus of spoken discourse. Please note we checked and updated the corpus once after the paper, so there might be minor change with the number of the relations.
